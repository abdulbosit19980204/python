# Django Admin

# Django Admin is a really great tool in Django, it is actually a CRUD* user interface of all your models!

# CRUD* stands for Create Read Update Delete.
# It is free and comes ready-to-use with Django!

# Getting Started

# To enter the admin user interface, start the server by navigating to the /myworld folder and execute this command!

" py manage.py runserver"

# In the browser window, type "127.0.0.1:8000/admin" in the address bar

# The reason why this URL goes to the Django admin log in page can be found in the urls.py file of your project

# urls.py file
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('', include('members.urls')),
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls)
]

# The urlpatterns[] list takes requests going to admin/ and sends them to admin.site.urls, which is part of a built-in
# application that comes with Django, and contains a lot of functionality and user interface, one of them being the
# log-in user interface.
