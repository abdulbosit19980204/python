# PostgreSQL - Add Members

# Members
# The "My Tennis Club" project has no members: 127.0.0.1:8000
# That is because we have created a brand new database, and it is empty
# The old SQLite database contained 5 members, so let us dive into the admin interface and add the same 5 members

# But first we have to create a new superuser.

# Create superuser
# Since we now have a new database, we have to create the superuser once again:
# This is done by typing this command in the command view

# py manage.py createsuperuser

# which will  give this prompt
