# Install Django
# Now that we have created a virtual environment, we are ready to install Django.

# Note: Remember to install Django while you are in the virtual environment!

# Django us installed using pip, with this command:
# Windows
# py -m pip install Django

# Unix/MacOS:
# python -m pip install Django


# Check Django Version
# You can check if Djnago is installed by asking for its version number like this:
# django-admin --version

# If Django is installed, you will get a result with the version number:
# Our django version is 5.0.2
