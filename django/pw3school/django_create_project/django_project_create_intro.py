# Django Create Project

# My First Project
# Once you have come up with a suitable name for your Django project, like min: my_tennis_club,
# navigate to where in the file system you want to store the code (in the virtual environment),
# I will navigate to the myworld folder, and run this command prompt:

# django_admin startproject my_tennis_club

# Django creates a my_tennis_club folder on my computer, with this content:

"""
my_tennis_club
    manage.py
    my_tennis_club/
        __init__.py
        asgi.py
        setting.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py
"""

# These are all files and folders with a specific meaning, you will learn about some of them later in this tutorial,
# but for now, it is more important to know that this is the location of your project,
# and that you can start building applications int it.

# Run the Django Project

# Now that you have a Django project, you can run it, and see what it looks like in a browser.
# Navigate to the /my_tennis_club folder and execute this command in the command prompt:

# py manage.py runserver

# Open a new browser window and type 127.0.0.1:8000 in the address bar
# The result message showed and run it  if all them correct


# What's Next?

# The next step is to make an app in your project.
# You cannot have a web page created with Django without an app.
