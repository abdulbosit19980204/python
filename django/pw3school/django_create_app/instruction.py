# Django Create App

# What is an App?

# An app is a web application that has a specific meaning in your project, like a home page, a contact from,
# or  members database.

# In this tutorial we will create an app that allows us to list and register members in a database.

# But first, let's just create a simple Django app that displays "Hello World"/

# Create App

# I will name my app "members"

# Start by navigating to the selected location where you want to store the app, in my case the my_tennis_club folder,
# and run the command below.

# If the server is still running, and you are not able to write commands, press ctrl+break or ctrl+c to stop the server
# and you should be back in the virtual environment

# py manage.py startapp members

# Django creates a folder named "members" in my project, with this content

# First, take a look at the file called "views.py"
# This is where we gather the information we need to send back a proper response.
