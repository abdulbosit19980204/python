# Python MongoDB
# Python can be used in database applications
# One of the most popular NoSQL database is MongoDB

# MongoDB

# MongoDB Stores data in JSON-like documents, which makes the database very flexible and scalable
# To be able to experiment with the code examples in this tutorial you will need access to a MongoDB database

# PyMongo
# Python needs a MongoDB driver to access the MongoDB database
# In this tutorial we will use the MongoDB driver "PyMongo"
# Recommended that you use pip to install "PyMongo"
# PIP is most likely already installed in your Python enviroment
# Navigate your command line to the location of PIP, and type the following

# Download and install "PyMongo": python -m pip install pymongo

# Now you have downloaded and installed a mongodb driver

# Test PyMongo
# To test if the installation was successful, or if you already have "pymongo" installed, create a Python page
# with the following content

import pymongo
# If the above code was execude with no errors, pymongo installed and ready to be used
