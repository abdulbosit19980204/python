# Machina Learning

# Machine Learning is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome.
# Where to start
# In this tutorial we will go back to mathematics and study statistics, and how to calculate important numbers based on data sets
# We will also learn how to use various Python modules to get the answer we need
# And we will learn how to make function that are able to predict the outcome based on what we have learned

# Data Set
# In the mind of a computer, a data set is any collection of data. It can be anything from an array to a complete database
# Example of an array
# [99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]

# Data Types
# To analayze data, it is important to know what type of data we are dealing with
# We can split the data types into three main categories

# Numerical
# Categorical
# Ordinal

# Numerical data are numbers, and can be split into two numerical categories
# Discrete Data
#  -counted data that are limited to integres. Example: The number of cars passing by
# Continues Data
#  -measured data that can be any number. Example: The price of an item, or the size of an item

# Categorical Data are values that cannot be measured up againist each other. Example:  color value, or any yes/no values

# Ordinal data are like categorical data, but can be measured up againist each other, Example: shcool grades where A is
# better than B, and so on

# By knowing the data type of your data source, you will be able to know what technique to use when analayzing them.
# You will learn more about statistics and analyzing data in the next chapters
