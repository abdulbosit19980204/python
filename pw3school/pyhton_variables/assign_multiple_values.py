# Many values to multiple variables

# Pyhton allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line
x,y,z = "Hello", "this","Multipele"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

# One value to Multiple Variables
# And you can assign the same  value to multiple variables in one line

x=y=z="Hello this is one value for all elements"

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

# Unpack a Collection
# If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple, etc. Python allows you to extract the values into variables.
# This is called unpacking

# Example
fruits= ["Hello", "I am ", "unpacking"]
x,y,z=fruits
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
