# Programming Paradigms in Python

"""
Paradigm can also be termed as a method to solve some problems or do some tasks.
A programming paradigm is an approach to solve the problem using some programming language, or also we can say it is
a method to solve a problem using tools and techniques that are available to us following some approach.
There are lots of programming languages that are known but all of them need to follow some strategy
when they are implemented and this methodology/strategy is paradigms.
"""

# Python supports three types of Programming paradigms

"""
    Object Oriented programming 
    Procedure Oriented programming
    Functional programming paradigms
"""

# Object Oriented programming paradigms

"""
In the object-oriented programming paradigm, objects are the key element of paradigms. Objects can simply be defined as
the instance of a class that contains both data members and the method functions. Moreover, the object-oriented style
relates data members and methods functions that support encapsulation and with the help of the concept of an inheritance,
the code can be easily reusable but the "major disadvantage" of object-oriented programming paradigm is that if the code is 
not written properly then the program becomes a monster.

Advantages

    Relation with Real world entities
    Code reusability
    Abstraction or data hiding
    
Disadvantages
    
    Data protection
    Not suitable for all types problems
    Slow speed
