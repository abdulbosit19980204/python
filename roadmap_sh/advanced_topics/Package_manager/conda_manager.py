# Conda

# Conda is an open source package manager and it helps you find and install packages

# If you need a package that requires a different version of Python, you do not need to switch to different enviroment
# manager, becouse conda is also  an environment manager. With just few commands, you can  set up a totally  seperate
# environment to run that different version of Python, while contuining to run your usual version of Python in your
# normal environment
