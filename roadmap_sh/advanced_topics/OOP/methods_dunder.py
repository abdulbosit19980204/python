# Methods and Dunder

# Methods in python are very similar to functions except for two major differences.
#   *The method is implicitly used for an object for which it is called.
#   *The method is accessible to data that is contained within the class.

# Dunder or magic methods in Python are the methods having
# two prefix and suffix underscores in the method name.
# Dunder here means “Double Under (Underscores)”. These are commonly used for operator overloading.
# Few examples for magic methods are: init, add, len, repr etc.
