# Generator Compressions
from _ast import comprehension


# Generator comprehensions are a concise way to create a generator using a single line of code in Python.
# They are similar to list comprehensions, but instead of creating a list, they create a generator object that produces
# the values on-demand, as they are needed.


# Generator comprehensions are a useful tool for creating generators that generate a large sequence of values, as they
# allow you to create the generator without creating the entire sequence in memory, especially for large sequences.

# Introduction to generator expressions

# A generator expression is an expression that returns a generator object
# Basically, a generator function is a function that contains a yiled statement and returns a generator obejct.

# For example, the following defines a generator function

def squares(length):
    for n in range(length):
        yield n ** 2


# The squares generator function returns a generator object that priduces square bumbers of integers from 0 to length-1
# Because a generator obejct is an iterator, you can use a for loop to iterate over its elements:

print(*squares(5))

for square in squares(5):
    print(square)

# A generator expression provides you with a more simple way to return a generator object.
# The following example defines a generator expression that returns square numbers of integers from 0 to 4

squares = (n ** 2 for n in range(5))
# Since the squares is a generator object, you can iterate over its elements like this

for square in squares:
    print(square)

# As you can see, instead of using a function to define a generator function, you can use a generator expression
# A generator expression is like a list comprehension in terms of syntax. For example, a generator expression also
# supports complex syntaxes including:
"""
    if statements
    Multiple nested loops
    Nested comprehensions
"""

# However, a generator expression uses the parentheses () instead of square brackets []

# Generator expressions vs list comprehensions

# The following shows how to use the list comprehension  to generate square numbers from 0 to 4
square_list = [n ** 2 for n in range(5)]
# And this defines a square number generator:
square_generator = (n ** 2 for n in range(5))

# 1) Syntax
# In terms of syntax, a generator expression uses parentheses () while a list comprehension uses square brackets []

# 2) Memory utilization
# A list comprehension returns a list while a generator expression returns a generator object

# It means that a list comprehension returns a complete list of elements upfront.
# However, a generator expression returns a list of elements, one at time, based on request.


# A list comprehension is eager while a generator expression is lazy

# In other words, a list comprehension creates alle elements right away and loads all of them into the memory.

# Conversely, a generator expression creates a single element based on request.
# It loads only one single element to the memory

# 3) Iterable vs iterator

# A list comprehension returns an iterable.
# Int means that you can iterate over the result of a list comprehension again and again.
# However, a generator expression returns an iterator, specifically a lazy iterator.
# It becomes exhausting when you complete iterating over it
