# Request Body: Receiving JSON Data

# When you need to send data from a client to your API, you send it as a request body

# A request body is data sent by the client to your API.
# A response body is the data your API sends to the client.
# Your API almost always has to send a response body.
# But clients donâ€™t necessarily need to send request bodies all the time.
