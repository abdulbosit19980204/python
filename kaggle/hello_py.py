# Hello, Python!

# Python was named for the British comedy troupe Monty Python

# Order of operations
# The arithmetic we learned in primary school has conventions about the order in wich operations are evaluated.
# Some remember these by a mnemonics such as
# PEMDAS => Parentheses => Exponents => Multiplication => Division => Addition => Subtraction

# Python follows similar rules about which calculations to preform first. They're mostly pretty intuitive

# Builtin functions for working with numbers
# min and max return the minimum and maximum of their arguments, respectively
print(min(11, 22, 544, -45, 4, 44, -7))
print(max(11, 22, 544, -45, 4, 44, 78))

# abs return the absolute value of an argument
print(abs(44))
print(abs(-77))
