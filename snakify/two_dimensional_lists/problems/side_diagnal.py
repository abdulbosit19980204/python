# Side diagonal

# Statement
# Given an integer n , create a two-dimensional array of size (n√ón)
#  and populate it as follows, with spaces between each character:

# The positions on the minor diagonal (from the upper right to the lower left corner) receive 1 .
# The positions above this diagonal recieve 0 .
# The positions below the diagonal receive 2 . [[0,0,0,1],[0,0,1,2],[0,1,2,2],[1,2,2,2]]
